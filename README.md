# ClickScape
_Like RuneScape, only **click-ier**._

At Coder Academy we were given a day and a half to create anything we wanted using JavaScript to help solidify the knowledge we had gained over the past two weeks. And over that day and a half I gave birth to possibly the __most exhilarating__ and __fast-paced__ game that has hit the market to date! _citation needed._

# What is it?
ClickScape is an hybrid offspring of [Cookie Clicker](https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Cookie_Clicker_Wiki) and [OldSchool RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Old_School_RuneScape), where your only goal is to click different types of resources, E.G. rocks, trees, fish. When clicking a resource, you will gain experience for that specific skill, and with enough clicks you might even be congratulated with a level up. Also, if that wasn't enough action for you, each click will also give you resources for the skill you are training, which can be used to upgrade that skill and in-turn receive more resources per click. _which can be used to upgrade that skill and in-turn receive more resources per click_. Do you see where this is going...?
